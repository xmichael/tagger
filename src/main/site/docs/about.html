As part of the UK vision for supporting open discovery principles in relation to education materials, <a href="jisc.ac.uk">JISC<a> has 
sponsored a number of projects to assist in discovering and enriching existing resources. This site is the product of one such project 
which has delivered three things:

<ul>
<li> A basic <a href="/docs/Tagger_API_V1.5.pdf">web service API</a> based around <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">ExifTool</a>, suitable for 3rd party use to geo-tag/geo-code
        image, audio, and video metadata.

<li> A demo web client (this site) enabling user upload, metadata parsing (from resource) and metadata
        enrichment (map based geo-tagging/geo-coding);

<li> An Open metadata corpus  of geo-tagged/geo-coded enriched records with a REST based query interface. 
Currently, this bootstrap corpus consists of  approximately a quarter of a million creative commons licensed 
geotagged images mainly sourced from <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/">Geograph</a>. 
</ul>
<p>Tagger supports the <a href='http://discovery.ac.uk/businesscase/principles/'>open discovery metadata principles</a> .
